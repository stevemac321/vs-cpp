# vs-cpp

## Overview

This repository contains various C++ projects, including implementations of data structures, sorting algorithms, and other coding exercises.

## Projects

- **RBTree**: Red-Black Tree implementation.
- **Sorts**: Various sorting algorithms.
- **OpenTable**: Open addressing hash table implementation.
- **Geeks**: Solutions to GeeksForGeeks problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake (optional, for building the projects)

### Building the Projects

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/stevemac321/vs-cpp.git
    cd vs-cpp
    ```

2. Build using your preferred method (e.g., using a CMake file, or directly with a compiler).

### Running the Projects

- Each project contains its own main file. Navigate to the project directory and compile the main file.
    ```sh
    cd RBTree
    g++ main.cpp -o RBTree
    ./RBTree
    ```

## Contributing
